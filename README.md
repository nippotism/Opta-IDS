# Opta-IDS (Optimizing Machine Learning Models for Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System)

This repository contains a web application developed with Python and Flask, designed to demonstrate and optimize machine learning models for an anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It aims to assist in identifying unusual patterns that may indicate potential threats in a network.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model Integration**: Leverages pre-trained models to detect anomalies in data inputs.
- **API Interface**: Provides endpoints to input features and receive model predictions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Users can visualize predictions and optimize model parameters for better performance.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.8+
- **Flask** 2.0.1+
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Other Libraries**: Gunicorn (for deployment)

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Anomaly-IDS-Optimization.git
   cd Anomaly-IDS-Optimization
  ```
